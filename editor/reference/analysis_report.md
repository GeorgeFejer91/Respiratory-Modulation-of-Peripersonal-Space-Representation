# Study 5 · Reproducible publication companion analysis

reproducible analysis draft for author review

The released dataset contains 42 independent participants and 17,114 observed trials of 17,136 planned slots. The primary participant-wide mean ±2.5 sample-SD trim removed 382 recorded hits, retaining 8,916 Audio–Tactile and 4,396 Baseline RTs. There were 105 hit-labelled trials without RT (80 Audio–Tactile).

## Primary question

The Condition × Phase × numeric SOA random-intercept ML comparison gives χ²(1)=0.023519, p=0.878116. The interaction is 0.814770 ms per SOA SD, model-based 95% Wald CI [-9.598235, 11.227775]. A non-significant result does not establish equivalence or a zero effect.

## Sigmoid viability

0/168 registered-axis trial cells satisfy R²≥.70. The maximum saturated five-SOA trial-level R² ceiling is 0.430205. Any deterministic curve depending only on these SOAs is bounded by this ceiling, independently of sigmoid parameter bounds. Boundary/MAIA/SpFrRef inference remains gated when participant fits are not interpretable. Group and five-mean fits are descriptive.

## Interpretation and unavailable provenance

- No failure to reject is interpreted as equivalence or proof of zero effect.
- Same-SOA-label Baseline subtraction is not a verified cue-time-matched contrast.
- Sigmoid bounds are an explicit reimplementation; saturated R² ceilings independently bound viability.
- JZS paired-contrast Bayes factors are exploratory and are not a mixed-model Bayes factor.
- Waveform cue-time and RT-onset validation: original recordings are not in the released CSVs.
- Measured respiratory compliance: phase labels are scheduled/instructed, not belt-verified.
- Pilot dates, acquisition-version effects and two source-onset exclusions: required provenance metadata are not released.

The result ZIP contains model and diagnostic tables, participant QC, cell/curve summaries, sigmoid fits, the retained RT table, SVG figures, and the full JSON report. The manifest records exact input/output hashes. Primary models always use the fixed analysis contract and are independent of the preparation preview controls.
